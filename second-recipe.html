            Roast veal with potatoes is a great classic to enjoy at the dinner table with the family reunited. The tender slices of meat served with gravy and the ever-present baked potatoes have always been a guarantee to bring adults and children together.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>600 g rump of veal</li> 
            <li>1 kg potatoes</li>
            <li>50 g white wine</li>
            <li>2 sprigs rosemary </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>40 g extra virgin olive oil</li> 
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h3>Preparation and Baking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step
                <p>To begin with, wash, dry and peel the potatoes. add rosemary and garlic. then transfer to a baking tray and bake in the oven at 200° for 20 minutes.</p>
            </li>
         
            <li>Step
                <p>Bind the meat and season it with all the flavourings. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the meat, allowing it to brown on all sides over medium-high heat: so every minute or so you will have to turn it with tongs or wooden spoons, making sure the meat browns well.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>Step
               <p>When all sides of the piece of meat are well sealed, deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate for a few moments, then turn off the flame. Place the meat in the centre of the pan, making space between the potatoes.</p>
            </li>
         
            <li>Step
                <p>Sprinkle the piece of veal with the sauce and stick a roasting thermometer into the centre of the meat. Then continue cooking, still at 200°,  approximately 35 minutes. When this time has elapsed, your roast veal with potatoes will be ready: wait a few minutes before removing the string and slicing this goodness.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>Step
                <p>When turning the meat, remember never to use sharp utensils as the juices could escape and make the meat tough. If you want to make the meat more fragrant, add a few sage leaves and a bay leaf to the rosemary or add them to the potatoes.</p>

        </ol>
