    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>5 g ginger powder</li> 
        <li>350 g flour 00</li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>5 g cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>160 g sugar</li> 
        <li>110 g cold butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 pinch fine salt</li>
        <li>50 g honey </li>  
        </ul>

    <h3>Preparation and Baking</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Step <br>
                To make the gingerbread cookies, start with the spiced shortbread: pour the flour and all the spices: ground cloves, cinnamon powder, grated nutmeg and ginger powder into the blender fitted with blades. Also add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, the granulated sugar. Then add a pinch of salt and pour in the honey.
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                Pour the egg into the center and incorporate it into the dough first with a fork then with your hands. Knead quickly and once the dough has taken on consistency, form a flat ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the dough to firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                Take the dough, roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured pastry board to a thickness between 7 mm and 1 cm. Cut out the shortcrust pastry with your favorite Christmas shapes; we chose classic gingerbread men. If you want, at this stage you can pierce the cookies at the height of the little heads of the men to pass a ribbon through and be able to hang them on the tree
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                With the given amounts you will get about 15 cookies. Transfer the cookies to a drip pan lined with baking paper and bake the cookies in a static oven preheated to 170° for about 15 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>
