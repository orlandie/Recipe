    <img src="" alt="meat" width="900" height="600">

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>600 g rump of veal</li> 
        <li>1 kg potatoes</li>
        <li>50 g white wine</li>
        <li>2 sprigs rosemary </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>40 g extra virgin olive oil</li> 
        <li>Fine salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preparation and Baking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step <br>
            To begin with, wash, dry and peel the potatoes. add rosemary and garlic. then transfer to a baking tray and bake in the oven at 200° for 20 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Step <br>
            Bind the meat and season it with all the flavourings. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the meat, allowing it to brown on all sides over medium-high heat: so every minute or so you will have to turn it with tongs or wooden spoons, making sure the meat browns well.
        </li>

        <li>Step <br>
            When all sides of the piece of meat are well sealed, deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate for a few moments, then turn off the flame. Place the meat in the centre of the pan, making space between the potatoes.
        </li>

        <li>Step <br>
            Sprinkle the piece of veal with the sauce and stick a roasting thermometer into the centre of the meat. Then continue cooking, still at 200°,  approximately 35 minutes. When this time has elapsed, your roast veal with potatoes will be ready: wait a few minutes before removing the string and slicing this goodness
        </li>

        <li>Step <br>
            When turning the meat, remember never to use sharp utensils as the juices could escape and make the meat tough. If you want to make the meat more fragrant, add a few sage leaves and a bay leaf to the rosemary or add them to the potatoes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <img src="img/1.jpg" alt="cookies" width="900" height="600">

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>5 g ginger powder</li> 
        <li>350 g flour 00</li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>5 g cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>160 g sugar</li> 
        <li>110 g cold butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 pinch fine salt</li>
        <li>50 g honey </li>  
        </ul>

    <h3>Preparation and Baking</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Step <br>
                To make the gingerbread cookies, start with the spiced shortbread: pour the flour and all the spices: ground cloves, cinnamon powder, grated nutmeg and ginger powder into the blender fitted with blades. Also add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, the granulated sugar. Then add a pinch of salt and pour in the honey.
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                Pour the egg into the center and incorporate it into the dough first with a fork then with your hands. Knead quickly and once the dough has taken on consistency, form a flat ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the dough to firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                Take the dough, roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured pastry board to a thickness between 7 mm and 1 cm. Cut out the shortcrust pastry with your favorite Christmas shapes; we chose classic gingerbread men. If you want, at this stage you can pierce the cookies at the height of the little heads of the men to pass a ribbon through and be able to hang them on the tree
            </li>

            <li>Step <br>
                With the given amounts you will get about 15 cookies. Transfer the cookies to a drip pan lined with baking paper and bake the cookies in a static oven preheated to 170° for about 15 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>
