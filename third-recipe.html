            Gingerbread is a sweet food product. Specifically, a dough made by mixing a mixture of honey or molasses and beet or brown sugar, flavored with ginger and cinnamon, with the possible addition of cloves, is called gingerbread. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>5 g ginger powder</li> 
            <li>350 g flour 00</li>
            <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
            <li>5 g cinnamon powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>160 g sugar</li> 
            <li>110 g cold butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 pinch fine salt</li>
            <li>50 g honey </li>  
            </ul>
    
        <h3>Preparation and Baking</h3>
    
            <ol>
                <li>Step
                    <p>To make the gingerbread cookies, start with the spiced shortbread: pour the flour and all the spices: ground cloves, cinnamon powder, grated nutmeg and ginger powder into the blender fitted with blades. Also add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, the granulated sugar. Then add a pinch of salt and pour in the honey.</p>
                </li>
              
                <li>Step
                    <p>Pour the egg into the center and incorporate it into the dough first with a fork then with your hands. Knead quickly and once the dough has taken on consistency, form a flat ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the dough to firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
            
                <li>Step
                    <p>Take the dough, roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured pastry board to a thickness between 7 mm and 1 cm. Cut out the shortcrust pastry with your favorite Christmas shapes; we chose classic gingerbread men. If you want, at this stage you can pierce the cookies at the height of the little heads of the men to pass a ribbon through and be able to hang them on the tree.</p>
                </li>
         
                <li>Step
                    <p>With the given amounts you will get about 15 cookies. Transfer the cookies to a drip pan lined with baking paper and bake the cookies in a static oven preheated to 170° for about 15 minutes.</p> 
                </li>
            </ol>
